# Feature Power
Katherine A. Fotion and her advisor Prof. Kazunori Okada introduced a
model-instance specific approach to determining feature and coalition power
for Random Forest classifiers in 2018:
[Feature power: a new variable importance measure for random
forests](https://scholarworks.calstate.edu/concern/theses/ht24wk95g).

The code used in her thesis is shared with Katie's permission as a reference
in a [dedicated branch](https://github.com/JakobDohrmann/FeaturePower/tree/kfotion).
All rights and responsibilities for the code lie with her.

I expanded the original theory in my own Thesis with Prof. Okada:
[Optimizing a Prediction Pipeline by Prepending an Efficient Low-Fidelity
Model]()

The expanded code is made available as a python package to facilitate
further improvement and integration in your own projects in the [master
branch](https://github.com/JakobDohrmann/FeaturePower/tree/master).
